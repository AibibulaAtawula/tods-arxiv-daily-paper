However, current approaches generally integrate knowledge retrieval and response generation, which poses scalability challenges when dealing with extensive knowledge bases. Taking inspiration from open-domain question answering, we propose a retriever-generator architecture that harnesses a retriever to retrieve pertinent knowledge and a generator to generate system responses.~Due to the lack of retriever training labels, we propose relying on feedback from the generator as pseudo-labels to train the retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a dual-feedback mechanism that generates both positive and negative feedback based on the output of the generator. Our method demonstrates superior performance in task-oriented dialogue tasks, as evidenced by experimental results on three benchmark datasets. |[2310.14528v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14528v1)|null|\n",

In this work, we take stock of and empirically analyse task performance disparities that exist between multilingual task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems. We first define new quantitative measures of absolute and relative equivalence in system performance, capturing disparities across languages and within individual languages. Through a series of controlled experiments, we demonstrate that performance disparities depend on a number of factors: the nature of the ToD task at hand, the underlying pretrained language model, the target language, and the amount of ToD annotated data. We empirically prove the existence of the adaptation and intrinsic biases in current ToD systems: e.g., ToD systems trained for Arabic or Turkish using annotated ToD data fully parallel to English ToD data still exhibit diminished ToD task performance. Beyond providing a series of insights into the performance disparities of ToD systems in different languages, our analyses offer practical tips on how to approach ToD data collection and system development for new languages. |[2310.12892v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12892v1)|null|\n",

We present InstructTODS, a novel off-the-shelf framework for zero-shot end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems that can adapt to diverse domains without fine-tuning. By leveraging LLMs, InstructTODS generates a proxy belief state that seamlessly translates user intentions into dynamic queries for efficient interaction with any KB. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructTODS achieves comparable performance to fully fine-tuned TODS in guiding dialogues to successful completion without prior knowledge or task-specific data. Furthermore, a rigorous human evaluation of end-to-end TODS shows that InstructTODS produces dialogue responses that notably outperform both the gold responses and the state-of-the-art TODS in terms of helpfulness, informativeness, and humanness. Moreover, the effectiveness of LLMs in TODS is further supported by our comprehensive evaluations on TODS subtasks: dialogue state tracking, intent classification, and response generation.

However, widely used generative models such as T5 and ChatGPT often struggle to differentiate subtle differences among the retrieved KB records when generating responses, resulting in suboptimal quality of generated responses. In this paper, we propose the application of maximal marginal likelihood to train a perceptive retriever by utilizing signals from response generation for supervision.

In an effort to move toward automated evaluation of TOD, we propose a novel user simulator built using recently developed large pretrained language models (LLMs). In order to increase the linguistic diversity of our system relative to the related previous work, we do not fine-tune the LLMs used by our system on existing TOD datasets; rather we use in-context learning to prompt the LLMs to generate robust and linguistically diverse output with the goal of simulating the behavior of human interlocutors. Unlike previous work, which sought to maximize goal success rate (GSR) as the primary metric of simulator performance, our goal is a system which achieves a GSR similar to that observed in human interactions with TOD systems. Using this approach, our current simulator is effectively able to interact with several TOD systems, especially on single-intent conversational goals, while generating lexically and syntactically diverse output relative to previous simulators that rely upon fine-tuned models. Finally, we collect a Human2Bot dataset of humans interacting with the same TOD systems with which we experimented in order to better quantify these achievements. |[2309.13233v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13233v1)|null|\n",

While unlike the general dialogue system which emphasizes the semantic performance, the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems aim to achieve the dialogue goal efficiently and successfully in multiple turns. Unfortunately, existing LLM-induced ToD systems lack the direct reward toward the final goal and do not take account of the dialogue proactivity that can strengthen the dialogue efficiency. To fill these gaps, we introduce the ProToD (Proactively Goal-Driven LLM-Induced ToD) approach, which anticipates the future dialogue actions and incorporates the goal-oriented reward signal to enhance ToD systems. Additionally, we present a novel evaluation method that assesses ToD systems based on goal-driven dialogue simulations. This method allows us to gauge user satisfaction, system efficiency and successful rate while overcoming the limitations of current Information and Success metrics. Empirical experiments conducted on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset demonstrate that our model can achieve superior performance using only 10% of the data compared to previous end-to-end fully supervised models.

While substantial efforts have been devoted to ERC for chit-chat dialogues, the task-oriented counterpart is largely left unattended. Directly applying chit-chat ERC models to task-oriented dialogues (ToDs) results in suboptimal performance as these models overlook key features such as the correlation between emotions and task completion in ToDs. In this paper, we propose a framework that turns a chit-chat ERC model into a task-oriented one, addressing three critical aspects: data, features and objective. First, we devise two ways of augmenting rare emotions to improve ERC performance. Second, we use dialogue states as auxiliary features to incorporate key information from the goal of the user. Lastly, we leverage a multi-aspect emotion definition in ToDs to devise a multi-task learning objective and a novel emotion-distance weighted loss function. Our framework yields significant improvements for a range of chit-chat ERC models on EmoWOZ, a large-scale dataset for user emotion in ToDs. We further investigate the generalisability of the best resulting model to predict user satisfaction in different ToD datasets.

Our method is a model-agnostic approach and does not require prompt-tuning as only input data without a prompt. As results of the experiment, our method shows competitive performance on the MultiWOZ benchmark compared to the existing end-to-end models.

Existing low-cost approaches that rely on cross-lingual embeddings or naive machine translation sacrifice a lot of accuracy for data efficiency, and largely fail in creating a usable dialogue agent. We propose automatic methods that use ToD training data in a source language to build a high-quality functioning dialogue agent in another target language that has no training data (i.e. zero-shot) or a small training set (i.e. few-shot). Unlike most prior work in cross-lingual ToD that only focuses on Dialogue State Tracking (DST), we build an end-to-end agent.   We show that our approach closes the accuracy gap between few-shot and existing full-shot methods for ToD agents.

Comparing ranked lists of multiple generated responses against the \"gold response\" (from evaluation data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good responses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in this work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses, that is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of overgenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to select high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated by the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring function to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus low-scoring partitions. At training, the high-scoring partition comprises all generated responses whose similarity to the gold response is higher than the similarity of the greedy response to the gold response. At inference, the aim is to estimate the probability that each overgenerated response belongs to the high-scoring partition, given only previous dialogue history.

The interactions often take place on semantic level for efficiency, but there is still a gap from semantic actions to natural language, which causes a mismatch between training and deployment environment. Incorporating a natural language generation (NLG) module with USs during training can partly deal with this problem. However, since the policy and NLG of USs are optimised separately, these simulated user utterances may not be natural enough in a given context. In this work, we propose a generative transformer-based user simulator (GenTUS). GenTUS consists of an encoder-decoder structure, which means it can optimise both the user policy and natural language generation jointly. GenTUS generates both semantic actions and natural language utterances, preserving interpretability and enhancing language variation. In addition, by representing the inputs and outputs as word sequences and by using a large pre-trained language model we can achieve generalisability in feature representation. We evaluate GenTUS with automatic metrics and human evaluation. Our results show that GenTUS generates more natural language and is able to transfer to an unseen ontology in a zero-shot fashion. In addition, its behaviour can be further shaped with reinforcement learning opening the door to training specialised user simulators. |[2208.10817v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10817v1)|null|\n",

Detecting the correct intent is essential yet difficult for email conversations where multiple directives and intents are present. In such settings, conversation context can become a key disambiguating factor for detecting the user's request from the assistant. One prominent way of incorporating context is modeling past conversation history like task-oriented dialogue models. However, the nature of email conversations (long form) restricts direct usage of the latest advances in task-oriented dialogue models. So in this paper, we provide an effective transfer learning framework (EMToD) that allows the latest development in dialogue models to be adapted for long-form conversations. We show that the proposed EMToD framework improves intent detection performance over pre-trained language models by 45% and over pre-trained dialogue models by 30% for task-oriented email conversations. Additionally, the modular nature of the proposed framework allows plug-and-play for any future developments in both pre-trained language and task-oriented dialogue models. |[2208.09439v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09439v1)|null|\n",

We observe that transformer based models such as UnifiedQA-T5 can be fine-tuned to perform logical reasoning (such as numerical and categorical attributes' comparison) over attributes that been seen in training time (e.g., accuracy of 90\\%+ for comparison of smaller than $k_{\\max}$=5 values over heldout test dataset). |[2202.04161v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04161v1)|null|\n",

In task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems, language models can be used for end-to-end training without relying on dialogue state tracking to track the dialogue history but allowing the language models to generate responses according to the context given as input. This paper conducts a comparative study to show the effectiveness and strength of using recent pretrained models for fine-tuning, such as BART and T5, on endto-end ToD systems. The experimental results show substantial performance improvements after language model fine-tuning. The models produce more fluent responses after adding knowledge to the context that guides the model to avoid hallucination and generate accurate entities in the generated responses.

Furthermore, most of the publicly available datasets only include written conversations, which are insufficient to reflect actual human behaviors in practical spoken dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose Task-oriented Dialogue Data Augmentation (TOD-DA), a novel model-agnostic data augmentation paradigm to boost the robustness of task-oriented dialogue modeling on spoken conversations. The TOD-DA consists of two modules: 1) Dialogue Enrichment to expand training data on task-oriented conversations for easing data sparsity and 2) Spoken Conversation Simulator to imitate oral style expressions and speech recognition errors in diverse granularities for bridging the gap between written and spoken conversations. With such designs, our approach ranked first in both tasks of DSTC10 Track2, a benchmark for task-oriented dialogue modeling on spoken conversations, demonstrating the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed TOD-DA. |[2112.12441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12441v1)|null|\n",

However, training a virtual assistant in other languages than English is often more difficult, especially for those low-resource languages. The lack of high-quality training data restricts the performance of models, resulting in poor user satisfaction. Therefore, we devise an efficient and effective training solution for multilingual task-orientated dialogue systems, using the same dataset generation pipeline and end-to-end dialogue system architecture as BiToD[5], which adopted some key design choices for a minimalistic natural language design where formal dialogue states are used in place of natural language inputs. This reduces the room for error brought by weaker natural language models, and ensures the model can correctly extract the essential slot values needed to perform dialogue state tracking (DST). Our goal is to reduce the amount of natural language encoded at each turn, and the key parameter we investigate is the number of turns (H) to feed as history to model. We first explore the turning point where increasing H begins to yield limiting returns on the overall performance. Then we examine whether the examples a model with small H gets wrong can be categorized in a way for the model to do few-shot finetuning on. Lastly, will explore the limitations of this approach, and whether there is a certain type of examples that this approach will not be able to resolve. |[2112.12318v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12318v1)|null|\n",

However, no matter how the dialogue history is used, each existing model uses its own consistent dialogue history during the entire state tracking process, regardless of which slot is updated. Apparently, it requires different dialogue history to update different slots in different turns. Therefore, using consistent dialogue contents may lead to insufficient or redundant information for different slots, which affects the overall performance. To address this problem, we devise DiCoS-DST to dynamically select the relevant dialogue contents corresponding to each slot for state updating. Specifically, it first retrieves turn-level utterances of dialogue history and evaluates their relevance to the slot from a combination of three perspectives: (1) its explicit connection to the slot name; (2) its relevance to the current turn dialogue; (3) Implicit Mention Oriented Reasoning. Then these perspectives are combined to yield a decision, and only the selected dialogue contents are fed into State Generator, which explicitly minimizes the distracting information passed to the downstream state prediction.

Generally in DST, the dialogue state or belief state for a given turn contains all the intents shown by the user till that turn. Due to this cumulative nature of the belief state, it is difficult to get a correct prediction once a misprediction has occurred. Thus, although being a useful metric, it can be harsh at times and underestimate the true potential of a DST model. Moreover, an improvement in JGA can sometimes decrease the performance of turn-level or non-cumulative belief state prediction due to inconsistency in annotations. So, using JGA as the only metric for model selection may not be ideal for all scenarios. In this work, we discuss various evaluation metrics used for DST along with their shortcomings. To address the existing issues, we propose a new evaluation metric named Flexible Goal Accuracy (FGA). FGA is a generalized version of JGA. But unlike JGA, it tries to give penalized rewards to mispredictions that are locally correct i.e. the root cause of the error is an earlier turn. By doing so, FGA considers the performance of both cumulative and turn-level prediction flexibly and provides a better insight than the existing metrics.

The scratch-based strategy obtains each slot value by inquiring all the dialogue history, and the previous-based strategy relies on the current turn dialogue to update the previous dialogue state. However, it is hard for the scratch-based strategy to correctly track short-dependency dialogue state because of noise; meanwhile, the previous-based strategy is not very useful for long-dependency dialogue state tracking. Obviously, it plays different roles for the context information of different granularity to track different kinds of dialogue states.

To encode the dialogue context efficiently, we utilize the previous dialogue state (predicted) and the current dialogue utterance as the input for DST. To consider relations among different domain-slots, the schema graph involving prior knowledge is exploited. In this paper, a novel context and schema fusion network is proposed to encode the dialogue context and schema graph by using internal and external attention mechanisms.

Recently, the copy-mechanism has been widely used in DST models to handle unseen slot values, which copies slot values from user utterance directly. In this paper, we aim to find out the factors that influence the generalization ability of a common copy-mechanism model for DST. Our key observations include: 1) the copy-mechanism tends to memorize values rather than infer them from contexts, which is the primary reason for unsatisfactory generalization performance; 2) greater diversity of slot values in the training set increase the performance on unseen values but slightly decrease the performance on seen values. Moreover, we propose a simple but effective algorithm of data augmentation to train copy-mechanism models, which augments the input dataset by copying user utterances and replacing the real slot values with randomly generated strings. Users could use two hyper-parameters to realize a trade-off between the performances on seen values and unseen ones, as well as a trade-off between overall performance and computational cost.

Here, we consider dialogue state as an explicit fixed-sized memory and propose a selectively overwriting mechanism for more efficient DST. This mechanism consists of two steps: (1) predicting state operation on each of the memory slots, and (2) overwriting the memory with new values, of which only a few are generated according to the predicted state operations. Our method decomposes DST into two sub-tasks and guides the decoder to focus only on one of the tasks, thus reducing the burden of the decoder.

Many discriminative models, especially end-to-end (E2E) models, are difficult to extract unknown values that are not in the candidate ontology; previous generative models, which can extract unknown values from utterances, degrade the performance due to ignoring the semantic information of pre-defined ontology. Besides, previous generative models usually need a hand-crafted list to normalize the generated values. How to integrate the semantic information of pre-defined ontology and dialogue text (heterogeneous texts) to generate unknown values and improve performance becomes a severe challenge.

Meanwhile, CEDST can effectively decompose the large state space into several small state spaces through multi-encoder, and employ multi-decoder to make full use of the reduced spaces to generate values. Multi-encoder-decoder architecture can significantly improve performance.

The proposed principled model is based on a Transformer encoder, trained on multiple tasks, and leveraged by a rich input that conditions the model on the target inferences. Conditioning the Transformer encoder on multiple target inferences over the same corpus, i.e., intent and multiple slot types, allows learning richer language interactions than a single-task model would be able to. In fact, experimental results demonstrate that conditioning the model on an increasing number of dialogue inference tasks leads to improved results: on the MultiWOZ dataset, the joint intent and slot detection can be improved by 3.2\\% by conditioning on intent, 10.8\\% by conditioning on slot and 14.4\\% by conditioning on both intent and slots.

Recently, attention mechanism has been shown to be effective in jointly optimizing these two tasks in an interactive manner. However, latest attention-based works concentrated only on the first-order attention design, while ignoring the exploration of higher-order attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a BiLinear attention block, which leverages bilinear pooling to simultaneously exploit both the contextual and channel-wise bilinear attention distributions to capture the second-order interactions between the input intent or slot features. Higher and even infinity order interactions are built by stacking numerous blocks and assigning Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) to blocks. Before the decoding stage, we introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion Layer to implicitly fuse intent and slot information in a more effective way. Technically, instead of simply concatenating intent and slot features, we first compute two correlation matrices to weight on two features. Furthermore, we present Higher-order Attention Network for the SLU tasks. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields improvements compared with the state-of-the-art approach.

People spend a significant amount of time every day on emails to exchange information, manage tasks and schedule events. Previous work has studied different ways for improving email productivity by prioritizing emails, suggesting automatic replies or identifying intents to recommend appropriate actions. The problem has been mostly posed as a supervised learning problem where models of different complexities were proposed to classify an email message into a predefined taxonomy of intents or classes. The need for labeled data has always been one of the largest bottlenecks in training supervised models. This is especially the case for many real-world tasks, such as email intent classification, where large scale annotated examples are either hard to acquire or unavailable due to privacy or data access constraints. Email users often take actions in response to intents expressed in an email (e.g., setting up a meeting in response to an email with a scheduling request). Such actions can be inferred from user interaction logs. In this paper, we propose to leverage user actions as a source of weak supervision, in addition to a limited set of annotated examples, to detect intents in emails. We develop an end-to-end robust deep neural network model for email intent identification that leverages both clean annotated data and noisy weak supervision along with a self-paced learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on three different intent detection tasks show that our approach can effectively leverage the weakly supervised data to improve intent detection in emails. |[2005.13084v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13084v1)|null|\n",

Their interconnected nature makes their joint modeling a standard part of training such models. Moreover, data scarceness and specialized vocabularies pose additional challenges. Recently, the advances in pre-trained language models, namely contextualized models such as ELMo and BERT have revolutionized the field by tapping the potential of training very large models with just a few steps of fine-tuning on a task-specific dataset. Here, we leverage such models, namely BERT and RoBERTa, and we design a novel architecture on top of them. Moreover, we propose an intent pooling attention mechanism, and we reinforce the slot filling task by fusing intent distributions, word features, and token representations. The experimental results on standard datasets show that our model outperforms both the current non-BERT state of the art as well as some stronger BERT-based baselines. |[2004.14848v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14848v2)|null|\n",

GFSID aims to discriminate a joint label space consisting of both existing intents which have enough labeled data and novel intents which only have a few examples for each class. To approach this problem, we propose a novel model, Conditional Text Generation with BERT (CG-BERT). CG-BERT effectively leverages a large pre-trained language model to generate text conditioned on the intent label. By modeling the utterance distribution with variational inference, CG-BERT can generate diverse utterances for the novel intents even with only a few utterances available. Experimental results show that CG-BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GFSID task with 1-shot and 5-shot settings on two real-world datasets. |[2004.01881v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01881v1)|null|\n",

Motivated by these requirements, we introduce intent detection methods backed by pretrained dual sentence encoders such as USE and ConveRT. We demonstrate the usefulness and wide applicability of the proposed intent detectors, showing that: 1) they outperform intent detectors based on fine-tuning the full BERT-Large model or using BERT as a fixed black-box encoder on three diverse intent detection data sets; 2) the gains are especially pronounced in few-shot setups (i.e., with only 10 or 30 annotated examples per intent); 3) our intent detectors can be trained in a matter of minutes on a single CPU; and 4) they are stable across different hyperparameter settings. In hope of facilitating and democratizing research focused on intention detection, we release our code, as well as a new challenging single-domain intent detection dataset comprising 13,083 annotated examples over 77 intents. |[2003.04807v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04807v1)|null|\n",

However, for non-programming users, the available possibilities for customizing their DA are limited and do not include the possibility of teaching the assistant new tasks. To make the most of the potential of DAs, users should be able to customize assistants by instructing them through Natural Language (NL). To provide such functionalities, NL interpretation in traditional assistants should be improved: (1) The intent identification system should be able to recognize new forms of known intents, and to acquire new intents as they are expressed by the user. (2) In order to be adaptive to novel intents, the Natural Language Understanding module should be sample efficient, and should not rely on a pretrained model. Rather, the system should continuously collect the training data as it learns new intents from the user. In this work, we propose AidMe (Adaptive Intent Detection in Multi-Domain Environments), a user-in-the-loop adaptive intent detection framework that allows the assistant to adapt to its user by learning his intents as their interaction progresses. AidMe builds its repertoire of intents and collects data to train a model of semantic similarity evaluation that can discriminate between the learned intents and autonomously discover new forms of known intents. AidMe addresses two major issues - intent learning and user adaptation - for instructable digital assistants. We demonstrate the capabilities of AidMe as a standalone system by comparing it with a one-shot learning system and a pretrained NLU module through simulations of interactions with a user. We also show how AidMe can smoothly integrate to an existing instructable digital assistant. |[2001.06007v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06007v1)|**[link](https://github.com/nicolas-lair/AidMe)**|\n",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SLU to better incorporate the intent information, which further guides the slot filling. In our framework, we adopt a joint model with Stack-Propagation which can directly use the intent information as input for slot filling, thus to capture the intent semantic knowledge. In addition, to further alleviate the error propagation, we perform the token-level intent detection for the Stack-Propagation framework. Experiments on two publicly datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance and outperforms other previous methods by a large margin.

With margin loss, we can learn discriminative deep features by forcing the network to maximize inter-class variance and to minimize intra-class variance. Then, we feed the feature vectors to the density-based novelty detection algorithm, local outlier factor (LOF), to detect unknown intents.

We take a multi-staged approach where both the processes (intent-classification and slot-tagging) inform each other's decision-making in different stages. The model breaks down the problem into stages, solving one problem at a time and passing on relevant results of the current stage to the next, thereby reducing search space for subsequent stages, and eventually making classification and tagging more viable after each stage. We also observe that relaxing rules for a fuzzy entity-matching in slot-tagging after each stage (by maintaining a separate Named Entity Tagger per stage) helps us improve performance, although at a slight cost of false-positives.

Multiple deep learning based models have demonstrated good results on these tasks . The most effective algorithms are based on the structures of sequence to sequence models (or \"encoder-decoder\" models), and generate the intents and semantic tags either using separate models or a joint model. Most of the previous studies, however, either treat the intent detection and slot filling as two separate parallel tasks, or use a sequence to sequence model to generate both semantic tags and intent. Most of these approaches use one (joint) NN based model (including encoder-decoder structure) to model two tasks, hence may not fully take advantage of the cross-impact between them. In this paper, new Bi-model based RNN semantic frame parsing network structures are designed to perform the intent detection and slot filling tasks jointly, by considering their cross-impact to each other using two correlated bidirectional LSTMs (BLSTM).

To exploit the semantic hierarchy for effective modeling, we propose a capsule-based neural network model which accomplishes slot filling and intent detection via a dynamic routing-by-agreement schema.
